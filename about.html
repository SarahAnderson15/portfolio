              <h2>My Role at Rooster Sailing</h2>
              <p>I am an E-Commerce Manager overseeing multiple retail sites and trade portals for Rooster Sailing. In my current role, I manage three Shopify-based retail websites, where I work with Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript to implement updates and new features based on the needs of the marketing team and the Managing Director. I am also responsible for maintaining our Amazon store and ensuring our product data is consistent across various platforms. My previous experience in the customer service team has been invaluable, allowing me to understand customer needs better and create a user-friendly online shopping experience.

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I have been working in my current position since July 2023, where I played a key role in transitioning our retail sites to a brand-new theme. This process involved implementing custom coding and collaborating with an outsourced web development team to ensure the site was both functional and user-friendly. I also worked closely with our SEO specialists to ensure our new theme met the necessary requirements for Google search visibility.</p>
                <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was furloughed from my job as a flight attendant. I then took on an administrative role at a vaccination center, managing data input and overseeing operations. After a few months, I was promoted to Non-Clinical Lead, where I led the administrative team and assisted with technical issues. This experience gave me a fresh perspective on adaptability and problem-solving, which further fueled my passion for web development.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>While I wasn’t always the most academic student, I thrived in IT and business classes, where I learned to build small websites and replicate existing ones. I initially pursued a cooking career at college, but after realizing it wasn’t the right fit, I transitioned to aviation with EasyJet. Although my work in aviation gave me valuable experience, I realized I wanted a more fulfilling career.</p>
                <P>In 2018, I enrolled in a Business A-Level, passing my exams with one of my highest grades. This helped me secure my position at Rooster Sailing, where I have grown professionally and am now expanding my skills by learning front-end development with Codecademy.</P>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Today, I combine my e-commerce experience with my growing web development skills to deliver user-centric online experiences. I am passionate about web development and excited to expand my skills further, creating innovative, responsive websites.</p>
