              <h2>My Role at Rooster Sailing</h2>
              <p>I am a knowledgeable E-Commerce Manager overseeing multiple regional retail sites and trade portals for Rooster Sailing. We manage three retail websites hosted on Shopify, where I work with Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript to implement updates and new features based on the needs of the marketing team and Managing Director. Additionally, I manage our trade portals for the US and European dealer networks, ensuring product information and data are consistently updated. I am also responsible for maintaining our Amazon store. My previous experience in the customer service team has given me valuable insight into customer needs, enhancing my ability to create an effective and user-friendly online shopping experience.

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p> I have been working in my current position since July 2023. During this time, I planned and led the transition to a brand-new theme for the Rooster Sailing retail sites. This included implementing custom coding and collaborating with a more experienced outsourced web development company. I also liaised with our SEO specialist team to ensure the new site incorporated all the essential elements for Google search success. It was during this process that my passion and interest in web development grew, leading me to pursue further learning and enroll in a web development course.</p>
                <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was furloughed from my job as a flight attendant due to lockdowns. During this time, I worked at a vaccination center, handling administrative tasks and inputting vaccine data into the NHS system. After two months, I was promoted to a non-clinical lead position, where I oversaw the center's operations, led the administrative team, and assisted with data entry and technical issues.</p>
