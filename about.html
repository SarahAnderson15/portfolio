              <h2>My Role at Rooster Sailing</h2>
              <p>I am a knowledgeable E-Commerce Manager overseeing multiple regional retail sites and trade portals for Rooster Sailing. We manage three retail websites hosted on Shopify, where I work with Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript to implement updates and new features based on the needs of the marketing team and Managing Director. Additionally, I manage our trade portals for the US and European dealer networks, ensuring product information and data are consistently updated. I am also responsible for maintaining our Amazon store. My previous experience in the customer service team has given me valuable insight into customer needs, enhancing my ability to create an effective and user-friendly online shopping experience.
